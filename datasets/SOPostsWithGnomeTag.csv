"257992","I am writing a console application which makes use of the F1 key (for help).  Unfortunately, while Konsole (of KDE) doesn't use this key, Gnome Terminal does, so the F1 key becomes inaccessible to my application.  I don't think there's a way to detect whether the F1 key is already mapped in the GUI side of things (Gnome Terminal), but if there is, the answer to that will obviate this question.  :)

Ergo, my next best bet is to try to detect whether I am running inside Gnome Terminal.  Is there some way to do that?  I'm primarily interested in gleaning this from within Ruby, but if it can be done via shell or environment variables, or virtual filesystem (/proc, /dev, etc.) then that will suffice.

I'm hoping for a reliable way to do this, but I can settle for ""best guess"" approaches like grepping the environment variables for clues that can let me reasonably assume that Gnome Terminal is the wrapping terminal.

Extra info: other keys are also ""stolen"" by Gnome Terminal.  I intend to display some sort of informative message about alternative keys for Gnome users.

"609282","I have a Gtk::TreeView with a Gtk::TreeModel and a Gtk::TreeModelFilter. The Tree Model is like this:

category1
  --&gt; actual row of data
category2
  --&gt; actual row of data


I want to filter on the contents of @search_entry, but I want category1 to be displayed if a row under it is still visible, and category2 to be hidden if there are no rows under it still visible. My understanding of Gtk::TreeModelFilter#set_visible_func is that you get the model and iter from the ""child model"", so that you can check whether to display the child iter. This function gets called on every iter in the model every time I call Gtk::TreeModelFilter#refilter.Therefore I'm saying: if the iter you just gave me is on the first level, get the path, step down one, convert to the same path on the filter's model and use whether the new path exists to test visibility. 

@store = Gtk::TreeStore.new(Gdk::Pixbuf, String, String, Menagerie::Program, TrueClass)
@tree_filter = Gtk::TreeModelFilter.new(@store)
@treeview.model = @tree_filter

# @first_time gets set to false after the model is loaded the first time
@first_time = true
@tree_filter.set_visible_func do |model, iter|
  has_visible_children = true
  begin
    iter_path = iter.path
    if iter_path.depth == 1 &amp;&amp; @first_time != true

"627351","I have been hacking on the code for Xournal in order to add auto-save functionality. My initial implementation was very dumb: every 60 or so seconds, do a save. The feature ostensibly works.

However, after testing it out for a while, I've noticed that when auto-save runs, the application temporarily freezes up, which is quite annoying if you're in the middle of a pen stroke. I'm trying to figure out how to fix this.

One possibility I've thought up of is for autosave to check whether or not the pen is touching the screen before autosaving; if it is touched, attach a one time only callback scheduled for a second after the pen is lifted. (if the same thing happens, repeat). Another possibility would be to optimize the save function sufficiently such that there is no gap (seems unlikely).

Anyone have any suggestions about this? Xournal uses the Gnome/GTK toolkit, and is written in C.

Update: I implemented the anti-clobber logic, and I'm very happy with the resulting autosave granularity and performance. One of those times threads are (thankfully) not necessary! Thanks all for your suggestions.

[Update - Solution for Windows]

Lovely, I think I got it working. I am using Python 2.5.4 with Pygame 1.9.1 in Eclipse on Vista 64-bit. Thus, this is for windows systems. The SetWindowPos function is documented <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633545%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a>. I will refer to this in my explanation.

Imports:

from ctypes import windll


Then I set up a variable that calls the ""SetWindowPos"" in user32:

SetWindowPos = windll.user32.SetWindowPos


Now, let's say I just made a window:

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((100,100), pygame.NOFRAME)


The next line is the key. This sets the window to be on top of other windows.

SetWindowPos(pygame.display.get_wm_info()['window'], -1, x, y, 0, 0, 0x0001)


Basically, You supply the hWnd(Window Handle) with the window ID returned from a call to display.get_wm_info(). Now the function can edit the window you just initialized.

The -1 is our hWndInsertAfter.

The MSDN site says:

<blockquote>
  A window can be made a topmost window either by setting the hWndInsertAfter parameter to HWND_TOPMOST and ensuring that the SWP_NOZORDER flag is not set, or by setting a window's position in the Z order so that it is above any existing topmost windows. When a non-topmost window is made topmost, its owned windows are also made topmost. Its owners, however, are not changed.
</blockquote>

So, the -1 makes sure the window is above any other existing topmost windows, but this may not work in all cases. Maybe a -2 beats a -1? It currently works for me. :)

The x and y specify the new coordinates for the window being set. I wanted the window to stay at its current position when the SetWindowPos function was called on it. Alas, I couldn't find a way to easily pass the current window (x,y) position into the function. I was able to find a work around, but assume I shouldn't introduce a new topic into this question.

The 0, 0, are supposed to specify the new width and height of the window, in pixels. Well, that functionality is already in your pygame.display.set_mode() function, so I left them at 0. The 0x0001 ignores these parameters. 

0x0001 corresponds to SWP_NOSIZE and is my only uFlag. A list of all the available uFlags are on the provided documentation page. Some of their Hex representations are as follows:


SWP_NOSIZE          =   0x0001
SWP_NOMOVE          =   0x0002   
SWP_NOZORDER        =   0x0004
SWP_NOREDRAW        =   0x0008
SWP_NOACTIVATE      =   0x0010
SWP_FRAMECHANGED    =   0x0020
SWP_SHOWWINDOW      =   0x0040
SWP_HIDEWINDOW      =   0x0080
SWP_NOCOPYBITS      =   0x0100
SWP_NOOWNERZORDER   =   0x0200
SWP_NOSENDCHANGING  =   0x0400


That should be it! Hope it works for you!

I'd like to use the most ""canonical"" way to find icons, mime-type/file type descriptions and associated applications on both KDE and gnome and I'd like to avoid any ""shelling out"" to the command line and ""low-level"" routines as well as avoiding re-inventing the wheel myself (no parsing the mime-types file and such). 

Edits and Notes:

Hey, I originally asked this question about the QT file info object and the answer that ""there is no clear answer"" seems to be correct as far as it goes. BUT this is such a screwed-up situation that I am opening the question looking for more information. 

I don't care about QT in particular any more, I'm just looking for the most cannonical way to find the mime type via C++/c function calls on both KDE and gnome (especially Gnome, since that's where things confuse me most). I want to be able show icons and descriptions matching Nautilus in Gnome and Konquerer/whatever on KDE as well as opening files appropriately, etc. 

I suppose it's OK that I get this separately for KDE and Gnome. The big question is what's the most common/best/cannonical way to get all this information for the Linux desktop? Gnome documentation is especially opaque. gnome-vsf has mime routines but it's deprecated and I can't find a mime routine for GIO/GFS, gnome-vsf's replacement. There's a vague implication that one should use the open desktop applications but which one to use is obscure. And where does libmagic and xdg fit in?  

Pointers to an essay summarizing the issues gladly accepted. Again, I know the three line answer is ""no such animal"" but I'm looking for the long answer.

It would be ok if there were 2-3 services at all. But we have a dozen. And restarting all of them after computer reboot is a real pain.

So what I want is a script, that once executed opens me new gnome-terminal window with a dozen of named tabs (one per service), with activated virtualenv in each and running bunch of service instances in that tabs. The best result I've got so far is:

"1832150","I am a linux (mostly ubuntu) user with a reasonable understanding of how the system works (although I am certainly not a linux guru!). In the past I have developed small cross-platform desktop applications in python/GTK and I delivered them to clients as self-contained filetrees, so that the only dependencies were Python itself and GTK.

Now I would like to develop a small applet for ubuntu, that I would like to release under GPL 2 or 3.

In particular these are the new steps I know I must learn in order to achieve my goal (it is very possible there are a few more that I am unaware of, though!):


Integrating with gnome: I want my application to be available as an applet in the taskbar.
Using D-bus: In particular I want my applet to use the new osd-notification framework for ubuntu, but communication with other applets is also a possible feature for a second iteration.
Packaging: I would like to setup a public PPA as soon as the application will reach alpha stage, but I also would like to use dependencies from existing packages in the official repos, rather than include the libraries again in my own package.


Of course official documentation will be my first source of knowledge, but - basing my judgment on the very useful answers that I received on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1812926/i-am-looking-for-tips-for-learning-vim-or-emacs-the-smart-way"">another topic</a> here on SO - I decided to turn to the SO community to collect additional advice like for example:


Are there additional steps to those I outlined before, that I have to learn in order to be able to implement my project?
Based on your own experience, would you advise me to learn those steps in advance (as the knowledge of those will influence my way of coding the core functionality) or would you consider integration with gnome / d-bus and packaging as ""higher encapsulating levels"" that can be added on top of core functionality afterwards (note: D-bus will be used at first just for pushing data. Input data will be retrieved with a webservice)?
Would you advise me to separate my application in two packages (back-end and front-end) or to keep it together in a single package?,
Do you know of any useful resource that you would advise me to look at, for learning any of the things that I have to?
Are you aware of any common ""beginner's mistakes"" that I should be aware of?


These questions are not meant to be exhaustive, though: if you feel that I am missing something from the general picture, you are more than welcomed to point me in the right direction!

Thank you in advance for your time!

PS: Should I have failed in explaining my final goal, take a look at <a href=""http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">project hamster</a>: what I want to achieve is similar in terms of user interface (meaning: the applet should display the status and clicking on it should open the application itself, from which you could both configure the applet and perform various operations).

I managed to see the appropriate dialogs to edit the property values by doubleclicking the button - crazy, strange, ugly behavior! But why on earth does nobody else know about this problem - I cannot find anything else on the net about it! Could it be related to this strange ""GDK native window problem"" on Gnome? HELP!

"2345643","Is there a way to launch a gnome-terminal from the command line (i.e., using the /usr/bin/gnome-terminal command) and have the new terminal inherit the environment variables and other set variables of terminal from which the command was run?  The scenario is thus:


Open a terminal
Set some variables
Set some environment variables
Launch an executable that needs the variables and the environment variables of the current terminal in a new terminal

"2503659","I'm writing a Java application with movable frames, and I've come across a quirk in Linux.  I'm running GNOME 2.16.0 under CentOS.

When I use JFrame.setBounds to set the bounds to any location that's half off the screen, it actually sets the location of the frame to be as close as possible to the bounds specified while still staying completely on the screen.

How do I tell Java to tell GNOME to actually put the frame where I specify, even if that's half off the screen?

Here's some sample code that demonstrates the problem, assuming that -50, 50 is off-screen.  The frame can still be dragged off the screen by the title bar, but any calls to setLocation or setBounds don't work.

This works fine in Windows.


JFrame frame = new JFrame();

Gnome-terminal lets you change the backspace character under Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Compatibility.  Unfortunately, no option works, as far as I can tell: whatever character I apply to Backspace via the settings, if I try mapping the character itself, like

:inoremap &lt;C-H&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;


then regular backspace and control-backspace both erase an entire word; and if I try mapping control plus that character, like

That is, I'd like a list of what the base menu categories and submenu are installed in a given machine. I would like to do with using fairly simple c/c++ function calls (with NO shelling out please). 

I understand that these menus are in the standard xdg format. 
I understand that this menu structure is stored in xml files such as:

/home/user/.config/menus/applications.menu

I want to find the existing menu structure). I've looked here: <a href=""http://library.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/menustructure-13.html.en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/menustructure-13.html.en</a> for more notes on these structures. None of this gives me a good idea of how determine the menu structures using a c/c++ program. 

The actual gnome menu structures seem to be a horrifically hairy things - they don't seem to show the menu structure but to give an XML-coded description of all the changes that the menus have gone through since installation. I assume gnome panels parses these file so there's a function buried somewhere to do this but I've yet to find where that function is after scanning library.gnome.org for a couple of days. I've scanned the Nautilus source code as well but Panels seem to exist elsewhere or are burried well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; term.feed(""a\nb"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr(term.get_text(lambda *a: True).rstrip())
'a\n b'


however, launching this code (little modified) as python script, different result is yielded:

$ python vte_wiredness_1.py 
''


strangely enough, pasting the code back into the (new) interactive python session also yields empty string:

&gt;&gt;&gt; import vte

&gt;&gt;&gt; term.feed(""a\nb"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr(term.get_text(lambda *a: True).rstrip())
''
&gt;&gt;&gt;


first thing caming on my mind was that the only difference between the two cases is the timing - there had to be some delay before get_text. unfortunately, preluding get_text with some seconds sleep did not help

then i thought it has something to do with X window environment. but the results are the same pure linux console (with some warning on missing graphics).

i wonder what causes such an unpredictable behavior (interactive console - pasted vs typed, and it's not the delay.. ant the interactive console has nothing to do with the vte terminal object.. i guess)

can someone explain what is happening? is it possible to use the VTE Term such way?

that the ""b"" letter in the output is preceded by the space, is another strangeness (all consecutive lines are preceded by more spaces.. looks like I have to send carriage return before the string.)

I used to use 'aterm' before then (with fluxbox, and other old-school things) but I see now that gnome-terminal is pretty usable in Ubuntu's Gnome.

However, there's one thing that really gets me - when you select something and then right click, it doesn't extend the selection, instead it brings up a pop-up menu.

I've been using terminals and emacs for years and right-click has always extended a selection - so there must be some way to configure gnome-terminal to do this. This is a habit I'm not going to be able to grow out of because I use it all the time in emacs.

Does anyone have the magic recipe to restore the behaviour I'm after please?

Alternatively, what's a good and modern alternative to gnome-terminal?

I'm developing a QT/c++ application under gnome. 

The application a main window and QListBox child window. 

Both of these windows show up as separate main windows when I alt-tab away from the application. 

How can I make it so that only one window is shown when I (or later the user) uses alt-tab?

I am guessing this behavior comes because one main window doesn't clip the subwindow - the subwindow extends the boundary of the main window. Gnome has bad alt-tab behavior for a number of other applications too, showing modal dialog boxes separately from main windows. But in the case of my app, this is really annoying. 

I am thinking I could make a giant transparent window that includes both existing windows. But it would be nicer to find a ""clean"" solution. 

(the most logical guess is indeed that it has something to do with window flags. I've tried every reasonable combination of flags I could think of. The window types are described <a href=""http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qt.html#WindowType-enum"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>)

Edit:
The app has a QWidget as its main window (Not QMainWindow), QListView is contained in the QWidget object and created by passing a point to the main window. 
 is styled with Qt::Tool | Qt::FramelessWindowHint. 

Edit2: The Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint style does work to remove the window from the alt-tab list. The problem is that it also makes the window ""unmanaged"" so it cover the other windows. I could manaully hide whenever I lose focus - prize now for a better solution.

So far I have traced that udev detects the disk and creates /dev/sdb (and /dev/sdb1 for partition 1) and that event about device added is sent as messages on dbus. I am able to mount the disk manually with udisks but not with gnome-disk-utility (palmiset).

One script is a 'server' script running locally and the other is client script that connects to it via a socket. Normally I just open a couple terminal tabs and run the server script in one and the client in the other.

However, now the server script is raising an sqlite OperationalError saying that one of my data tables doesn't exist. But when I run the scripts manually everything works fine. I have no clue what is going on, but I thought that maybe running the scripts together wasn't giving the server script enough time to initialize and make its connection to the database.

What confuses me, is that it is possible to change to ""smooth scrolling"" in Firefox, which makes it seem like each application handles its scrolling separately. However, when writing software for Linux, you don't really need to specify and it seems like GTK takes care of it on its own.

The reason I'm curious is because I wanted to know if Linux could have it's own ""accelerated"" scrolling, much like OS X. I know this is possible by app, because Google Picasa has its own built in.

Quick summary : I tried libpanelappletmm, but every program (even the examples supplied in the source code) segfaults when I try to add the applet in my panel.
So I now use the C library (libpanel-applet). First I looked for a way to wrap the PanelApplet Gobject in a gtkmm C++-object, for example a Gtk::EventBox (PanelApplet inherits from GtkEventBox). I tried to cast it, but Glibmm kept throwing a warning (""Failed to wrap object 'PanelApplet'"").

So I created a class ""Info"", inheriting from Gtk::HBox. In my main.cpp file I declare an instance of it, get the underlying GTK object (gobj method), and use the GTK+ functions to add it into the PanelApplet.

I'm calling gnome-terminal from a cronjob, in order to create a terminal accessible to the user. The terminal is initially given a specific program to run. e.g.

gnome-terminal --tab -e ""/usr/bin/myprog""


This works fine, except that when ""myprog"" exits, so does the gnome-terminal. How do I keep it running, but just drop back to a terminal prompt?

"4486376","I know there's several type of selection in Linux: primary, secondary, and clipboard, I treat the first two as short-term clipboard, and clipboard as long-term clipboard. Am I right? 

Now, since the primary/secondary selection is text-only, I want to copy image to the long-term clipboard, I don't know if there is a MIME type associated with it. Because the Screen Capture is able to copy the screenshot to clipboard, so I guess there is some meta data to describe it's in image format.  But commands like xsel doesn't give any option on operating image clipboard data. Neither copy image file to clipboard nor dump the image from clipboard to file is supported. 

After search the google, I found there's some support in Python/Gtk: 

import pygtk
pygtk.require('2.0')
import gtk
import os
def copy_image(f):
    assert os.path.exists(f), ""file does not exist""
    clipboard = gtk.clipboard_get()
    img = gtk.Image()
    img.set_from_file(f)
    clipboard.set_image(img.get_pixbuf())
    clipboard.store()


I haven't tried it myself, because I'm not familiar with Python, but that look like at least some programs support the image clipboard. 

Here is a question, since I guess the clipboard in GNOME may not have a MIME type, does most of Gnome applications share the same convention on image format?

And, what documents shall I refer to if I want to program with image clipboard to share images between different applications, for example one want 8-bit indexed bitmap and another want 24-bit RGB bitmap?

This works to some extent. -t ensures that signals like SIGINT are sent through the commands running remotely. 

However, when I ctrl-c the tail, I would really like to drop down to a bash terminal on the remote server. Right now, if I ctrl-c the tail, then the tail is closed, which causes ssh to exit, which causes the whole terminal to be closed.

What I would like is for the tail to be terminated and be left with a bash shell on the remote server.

I have tried the following:

gnome-terminal -e 'ssh -t server ""tail -F logfile; /bin/bash""'


but that doesn't seem to work. That is, if I run this without gnome-terminal, just ssh -t ..., then see the following:

"5417201","After many months of trying, searching, reviewing code, etc. I'm unable to find a solution to properly positioning a new window in QT. In my most basic case I simply want to get the final size of the window and center it under the mouse. It will be shifted to ensure that no part of the window is outside of the screen. I do not wish to have the window appear then move into position, that produces visual jarring, particularly with desktop FX turned on.

The problems I've encountered, not all of which have proper solutions:


frameGeometry is not always populated before the window has been shown before.
frameGeometry is sometimes just completely wrong, in particular on Windows 7.
Prior to display it is not possible to know whether sizeHint or size will be applied, or something else in between. That is, the size policy does not appear predictable.


Note that I know how to save/restore geometry of a previously created window. Despite QT defects here as well I have a working solution.

Also note that I cannot use the window manager default placement. For non-MDI apps on a multi-monitor setup their placement is terrible (often not even being on the same monitor as the mouse).

I'd also like to avoid sub-classing all widgets and dialogs just to implement the solution, as it would not be generic. If this is the only possible way then I'd be willing to consider it (should event filters also not be an option).

Does anybody have good workable solutions?

"5443250","In linux I want to run a gnome zenity progress bar window from PHP.  How zenity works is like this:

linux-shell$ zenity --display 0:1 --progress --text='Backing up' --percentage=0
10
50
100


So the first command opens the zenity progress bar at 0 percent.  Zenity then takes standard input numbers as the progress bar percentage (so it will go from 10% to 50% to 100% when you type those numbers in).

I can't figure out how to get PHP to type in those numbers though, I have tried:

exec($cmd);
echo 10;
echo 50;


And:

$handle = popen( $cmd, 'w' );
fwrite( $handle, 10 );


And:

$descriptorspec = array(
   0 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""r""),  // stdin is a pipe that the child will read from
   1 =&gt; array(""pipe"", ""w"")  // stdout is a pipe that the child will write to
);

$h = proc_open($cmd, $descriptorspec, $pipes);

fwrite($pipes[1], 10);


But none of them updates the progress bar.  In what way can I mimic the effect of the stdin on the linux shell to get zenity to update its progress bar?

If I do ToolbarStyle.TEXT it shows the test, if I use ToolbarStyle.BOTH it shows the icon over the text, but ToolbarStyle.BOTH_HORIZ or leaving it blank (both_horiz is default in gnome) it just shows the icon.

"6906040","I'm a Linux and gnome user, and I'm currently depending mainly on a notebook, and not surprisingly, I am not satisfied with the power quandary, so i recurred to power-management tools available for my system (currently Linux Mint 11), which is a really simple gui (gnome-power-preferences) with really few really basic features, which I'd love to expand.

I do not intend to work at low level features of power management, the states the are currently available are enough (suspend, hibernate, shutdown, do-nothing, monitor-brightness, downspin-hd, etc...), what I really need is a better way to create conditions in setting those states, which is, in the standard native tool, time and lid-closing, that's extremely limited.

So the question, I want to know what are my options to create scripts in any language(I'm willing to learn if i don't already know) that allow me to take a wider control of power-management conditions, i was think of(my possible settings):


down-spin disks immediately after lid closing and cut connection after n seconds.
don't cut connection after n seconds of lid-closing if bandwidth use is bigger than x bps
provide more statistical tools based on programs using, programs in background... services, etc.
create, save and load profiles that would automatically set monitor brightness, sound volume, wireless power, resource limits, etc... ex: 'college_ba.pp', 'default_ac.pp'...
brightness adjusting based on webcam shot illumination.
suspend or hibernate based on webcam shots without face for n seconds
etc


It may sound impossible and hard, I do not intend to have these stuff ready-to-use, as I said, i intend to use as much manual effort as needed, I just want to avoid low-level with existing libraries and tools, as much as possible, and i wish everyone to share information about any library, tool or project that comes to mind and deal with any subset of these things I've cited in this question.

This is a thing that i want from a long time, and just now i realize that this community could help me wide my options. My English is horrible I know, i learned online. I'm familiar with C++, C, Python and lately bash scripts. Thanks.

for the one and only GNOME Panel X window. But I suspect the GNOME
Panel window is not the only one that needs to be considered.  I say
that because there is a window at the bottom that xwininfo reveals
as ""Bottom Expanded Edge Panel"" that may or may not be in conflict
real-estate-wise, since only displays when the mouse is moved to the
very bottom of the X root window.  But if the GNOME Panel really is
the only one to consider, then that ""subtraction"" method might just be
good enough.

My use case is this: I am using <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAA&amp;url=http://www.rdesktop.org/&amp;ei=IA7AToNLq9iJAvaTzZED&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMP9DAfvWDNFMBbFla5KfFuDQ1xg"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""rdesktop"">rdesktop</a> to RDP into various
Microsoft Windows desktops. The user needs to decide, before executing
rdesktop, the dimensions on the X window, since it is not resizable
after it is displayed.  I need that window to consume the maximum
amount of root window real-estate provided it doesn't conflict with
the GNOME-managed windows like the GNOME Panel.  What I am doing now
is hardcoding the geometry for a specific desktop in my wrapper
scripts that call rdesktop, but that fails to do what I want because
I work from various desktops that necessarily vary in display
hardware, with a resulting variation in the X root window geometry.
Feeding the X root window's geometry to the rdesktop command results
in a RDP window that extends past the visible area on the GNOME
desktop since GNOME's window manager pushes the actual upper left
corner down to avoid overlapping with the GNOME panel, with the result
that a part of the RDP window is hidden from mouse manipulation.

I have tried using xwininfo -root -children to see if I could find
some X window in the immediate descendents of the X root that would
consistently be the window I could use to extract those dimensions,
but the names look like they are implementation details of the GNOME
desktop software (or the metacity WM), or both and might not be
something I want to rely upon.

"9606404","So I'm making a Gnome Shell extension. And I want to be able to run some command. (The command is actually ""synclient -m 100"", but that is off topic)

So, what I have done so far is 

s=GLib.spawn_async_with_pipes(null, [""synclient"",""-m"",""100""], null, GLib.SpawnFlags.SEARCH_PATH,null)
c=GLib.IOChannel.unix_new(s[3])


The first line spawns my process. It is definitely working.

s[3] is the file descriptor for the stout of the process.  (It has something to do with pipes. Not really sure about the whole pipe thing.)

Anyway, my problem is that I can't seem to read anything from the output of synclient.

<a href=""http://references.valadoc.org/glib-2.0/GLib.IOChannel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This</a> is what I'm using for reference, but it seems that not all of the functions work.  For example, I want to use add_watch, but that apperently doesn't work with gnome extensions.

I've tried using a bunch or read functions and specifically read_line_string, but they all have problems. For read_line_string it seems like it should all work except I can't figure out how to create a StringBuilder object to pass as an argument.

So, does anyone know how to get the output of a command?

Edit: also I'm kind of confused about which language the extensions use. I think it's javascript, but the docs I'm using seem to make me think Vala, whatever that is (I'm guessing a variation of java?).

Edit 2:

So, what I've got now is 

let [res, pid, in_fd, out_fd, err_fd] = 
  GLib.spawn_async_with_pipes(
    null, [""synclient"",""-m"",""100""], null, GLib.SpawnFlags.SEARCH_PATH, null);
out_reader = new Gio.DataInputStream({ base_stream: new Gio.UnixInputStream({fd: out_fd}) });


And to read a line:

let [out, size] = out_reader.read_line(null);


This gives me the output of the command, but it still doesn't give me any way to get some callback whenever the DataInputStream is changed. I need to be able to do something whenever there is a new line in the stream.

setenv GNOME_KEYRING_SOCKET /tmp/0123.1.sds/keyring-abcdef/socket ;setenv GNOME_KEYRING_PID 012345


Despite the fact that i can copy and paste that output to the command line and get it to work, if I enclose that statement in ticks to get it working on one line I get the following error:

<blockquote>
  Invalid null command.
</blockquote>

I researched it and saw it is related to a <a href=""http://zotline.com/shownote.zot/NoteNum/4076.html"" rel=""nofollow"">newline sneaking in</a> that needs to be escaped or removed; however, I still get the error even after adding replace commands for \r and \n like so:

&gt; | tr '\r' ' ' | tr '\n' ' ' |


What I'm looking for

I really just need anything I can add to my .cshrc file that will start the gnome-keyring-daemon.  If I'm on the wrong track, I'd be happy to hear an alternative approach.

Thanks!

One Last Thing I Tried

To really simplify this I've also tried to just set one variable at a time:

setenv GNOME_KEYRING_PID `echo -n `gnome-keyring-daemon` | sed 's/.*GNOME_KEYRING_PID=\([0-9]\+\)/\1/'`


Which also gives me a ""Invalid null command."" message despite the fact that this works:

setenv GNOME_KEYRING_PID `echo '1234'`

"9985140","I'm currently building a simple application on <a href=""http://live.gnome.org/Gjs"" rel=""nofollow"">Gjs</a>, which should change the background-image of my gnome-shell. A solution on how this can be done using the gsettings-tool can be found <a href=""http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/users/2011-August/402603.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

Since I want to build a desktop-application around it, I want to change the org.gnome.desktop.background.picture-uri-key by using Gio's <a href=""http://www.roojs.com/seed/gir-1.2-gtk-3.0/gjs/Gio.Settings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GSettings-class</a>. But using the set_X()-method does not change the value of the key.

This is my code to change the gsettings value:

var gio = imports.gi.Gio;

// Get the GSettings-object for the background-schema:
var background = new gio.Settings({schema: ""org.gnome.desktop.background""});

// Read the current Background-Image:
print( ""Current Background-Image: ""+background.get_string(""picture-uri"") );

if (background.is_writable(""picture-uri"")){
    // Set a new Background-Image (should show up immediately):
    if (background.set_string(""picture-uri"", ""file:///path/to/some/pic.jpg"")){
        print(""Success!"");
    }
    else throw ""Couldn't set the key!"";
} else throw ""The key is not writable"";


Reading the value does work as expected, the is_writable()-method returns true and the set_string()-method also returns true.

I have checked that I'm not in ""delay-apply"" mode and the key has a GVariantType of string, so the set_string()-method should work.

Using the normal gsettings command-line tool (as explained in the linked post) works just fine.

I can't figure out what the problem is, is there any place I can look for logs or something?

I can run from the terminal: pkexec ifconfig eth0 down and it will prompt for a password and then do it.

"10151433","I've just started fiddling with writing gnome-shell extensions, and would like to know how to get a list of contacts a user has.

I've tracked down some likely files: gnome-shell/js/ui/contactDisplay.js and gnome-shell/src/shell_contact_system.c.

Now I notice in shell_contact_system.c the following function:

/**
 * shell_contact_system_get_all:
 * @self: A #ShellContactSystem
 *
 * Returns: (transfer none): All individuals
 */
GeeMap *
shell_contact_system_get_all (ShellContactSystem *self)
{
  GeeMap *individuals;

  g_return_val_if_fail (SHELL_IS_CONTACT_SYSTEM (self), NULL);

  individuals = folks_individual_aggregator_get_individuals (self-&gt;priv-&gt;aggregator);

  return individuals;
}


This suggests that inthe javascript interface I can use function get_all (my belief is reinforced by the fact that the .c file also has a shell_contact_system_get_individual and contactDisplay.js demonstrates the use of Shell.ContactSystem.get_default().get_individual), so I try:

contactSys = Shell.ContactSystem.get_default();
// get contacts
contacts = contactSys.get_all();


It works! (I'm trying it out in Gnome-shell's ""looking glass"" javascript interpreter).

It appears to be a 'Gobject' so I have no idea what to do with this object to get the names of my contacts out. I notice (from the C code) that this object is a GeeMap *, so looking at the <a href=""http://people.gnome.org/~dvillevalois/libgee/doc/gee-1.0/Gee.Map.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation for Gee.Map</a>, I see I can do the following:

contacts.size   // returns 31, which is the number of contacts I have !
contacts.values // is a Gee.Collection
contacts.keys   // is a Gee.Set


I then try to look at contacts.values and contacts.key, noting the to_array() method these have:

contacts.values.to_array()
contacts.keys.to_array()


However when I do this I get an empty array back out: contacts.xxx.to_array().size is 0, yet contacts.size is 31 ?? !!

The same occurs when I attempt to use a contacts.map_iterator() to iterate through the map; it.get_value() and it.get_key() appear to be null.

So, my question is: How can I access the individual elements of contacts?

I do note that the comment for shell_contact_system_get_all says Returns: (transfer none): ... whilst shell_contact_system_get_individual says Returns: (transfer full): ..., and the latter function works (provided I know the ID of the individual I want to look up, which is my problem), whereas the former doesn't. Could this be something to do with it?

Also, as a workaround, I can currently make use of the contactSearchProvider class to achieve this (used by the overview when you intall gnome-contacts where you can type the name of a contact and they'll appear in the overview). I basically search for '' which should return me a list of every contact. It seems roundabout though - I feel I should just be able to use the get_all() method to get all the contacts without having to search on an empty string...

    const ContactDisplay = imports.ui.contactDisplay;
    cds = new ContactDisplay.contactSearchProvider;
    res = cds.getInitialResultSet(['']); 
    // woohoo! res.length is 31, and res[0], res[1], ... are all not null!

The only answers I found to similar questions use amixer, which seems to have no effect on Ubuntu 12.04. Running:

amixer set Headphone 10-


shows:

  Front Right: Playback 0 [57%] [-57.50dB] [on]


The x% changes each time I run it. Unfortunately, it has no effect on the actual volume. Eventually it says 0%, but volume is still at full blast.

The other downside is I have to specify the exact active output device, which I might not know if there are multiple devices. For example, if I have a ""Master"" and ""Headphone"", how do I determine which one is the active device?

I recently learned to use wmctrl to modify EWMH-compliant window options, but it also has no method to remove the titlebar (that I can see).

There must be some way to do this, however, because applications like Audacious can tell Gnome not to display window decorations.

Googling, I found some pages that discuss the issue of removing the titlebar with wmctrl, but in each case the solution was simply to fullscreen the window, such that the titlebar moved off the screen altogether.  (That's not what I'm looking for!)

"11282319","I've run into an odd problem in Vim.  I would like to drag and drop a file from my desktop or file manager into Vim and edit it.  Gvim handles this behavior correctly.

When I attempt to do the same thing in console Vim, the  path to the file name is inserted instead.  For example, if I drag and drop the file /home/myuser/foo.matic, it will apply the text string '/home/myuser/foo.matic' to the current buffer.

If I type :edit, then drag and drop the file name, Vim treats '/home/myuser/foo.matic' as a new directory.

I believe the problem here is the quotes before and after the file path.  These appear to be inserted by both gnome-terminal and terminator.  Is there a way to strip these quotes from the file name when dragging and dropping?  Alternatively, is there a way for Vim to ignore the quotes?

This seems to me to be a rather inefficient method: generating a new object every time the pointer moves; and considering I'm getting subpixel precision from my tablet this is rather often.

My question is: is there a way by which I can simply append to the existing bpath on each pointer motion as I would in the C version of this library?

"11943619","I'd like to write a Qt application which main purpose is to warn the user that there are things to do before he should shut down the computer. I thought this is possible, since a lot of applications ask the user to save before quitting when the computer is about to be shut down. I also want the user to be able to interrupt the shut down process, like those applications allow the user to say ""Cancel"".

Is there a way to do this in Qt?

If not, how to do this at least in a gnome session? (Support for more desktop environments would be nice, but currently this application is for me and my friends only, and we all use gnome.)

I read about the signal QCoreApplication::aboutToQuit(), but the documentation says that it doesn't allow user interaction. My application doesn't use any widget (maybe only a system tray icon), so the QWidget::closeEvent isn't of any use either.

Will handling the appropriate posix signal help? But as far as I know, such a signal handler may only contain trivial statements and asking the user whether to really shut down isn't trivial.

Here are some details if it helps: When the user wants to shut down the computer, my application will check if the repository (he configured to watch) is ""clean"", i.e. there is nothing to commit. If there is something to be committed, the application should warn the user and let him choose to ignore the uncommitted files or to abort the shut down process (in order to commit the changes).

"12267848","How do GUIs get built inside operating systems. Lets use two examples, say GTK+ in Ubuntu verses a Java JFrame. I thought that operating systems using some kind of graphical user interface would have to provide some system calls to be able to display windows. So for example, if I installed a version of Ubuntu on a machine, with out downloading any software I should be able to make a system call to display a window. It appears though that isn't the case. I have to install and download the SDK for GTK+ which allows me to create windows with buttons, etc. So then my question is with Java, how does Java then build it's JFrames? I understand that there is a Java Virtual Machine running ontop of the Linux system, but how does the Java virtual machine make calls to actually display the window? Along with GUIs comes the events that the user interacts with them. At the Java level, the JVM handles all the lower level calls, and you get OnClick() events etc. How does the JVM actually call and work with those calls? Same with GDK+? I understand this is a broad question with many different answers, but any help would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway, it does almost what I want it to; I end up with four terminals each running their own properly named instance of screen, and all but the last one linked to the original session. But not that last one. So here's the code, and I'm hoping someone can let me know why it's not behaving as expected:

#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..4}
do
    gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=hdesk$i -e 'screen -S hdesk'$i
done

screen -XS hdesk1 stuff 'top^M'

for i in {2..4}
do
    screen -XS hdesk$i stuff 'screen -x hdesk1^M'
done


I tried doing the same line by line from a terminal instead of running it as a script and it worked fine. For some reason the session 'hdesk4', while it exists, isn't attaching 'hdesk1'.

As for why, I'm using compiz, and I want this terminal to be sticky (present on all virutal desktops). But I have eight virtual desktops in two rows of four, and I don't want this sticky on the top row, just the bottom, so I can't just set a single terminal to be sticky. So any solution that achieves that goal but avoids this screen mess altogether would also be welcome.

edit: It now works, although I made no changes to the code or to anything else between the not working and the working. Just suspended my computer overnight and unsuspended.

I am running R (version 2.15.1) in a bash shell (version 4.2.36(1)) in the GNOME terminal (version 3.4.1.1). Sometimes I write my code in a text file and then paste it directly into the console (when running R). I didn't have any problems until the scripts I was pasting grew in length. Now, it appears that any code greater than 4206 characters (including \n) is rejected (i.e., the first 4206 characters are accepted and the remaining code is truncated; the truncation is accompanied by the terminal ""bell"" sound). This character limit is not specific to bash or GNOME terminal because I do not observe a character limit when pasting into e.g., vi. Therefore, I suspect that the character limit is imposed by R, but do not know how to change it, assuming it is a user-configurable parameter. Can the paste limit be changed and if so, what parameter governs it?

"13769741","I am trying to generate a subprocess for a gui which will spawn a terminal. I want the data produced by this terminal (stdout and stderr) to be displayed on the window that appears as well as to a set log file. When I type the command directly in to a shell it works as intended, but when provided to a QProcess as a start command it doesn't actually write anything to the file.

For example: if the user doesn't have the binaries installed it should write to bin.log that the command was not found. I have set my environment for the spawned QProcess to be the same as the running parent process (so that it can find bash and anything else), and have set the working directory before calling QProcess.start() method. I wrote a test case which follows:

gnome-terminal --title 'Sub-Terminal' -e 'bash -c ""foo [args to foo] |&amp; tee foo.log""'


In Qt I do the following:

QProcess *child = new QProcess(this);
QString   cmd   = ""gnome-terminal --title 'Sub-Terminal' -e 'bash -c \""foo [args to foo] |&amp; tee foo.log\""'"";
child-&gt;setProcessEnvironment(&lt;process environment I have created before&gt;);
child-&gt;setWorkingDirectory(&lt;current working dir&gt;);
child-&gt;start(cmd);
...


It generates the terminal but does not write any data to foo.log. I have also tried the following:

QProcess *child = new QProcess(this);
QString   prog  = ""gnome-terminal""
QStringList args;
args &lt;&lt; ""-x"" &lt;&lt; ""bash"" &lt;&lt; ""foo"" &lt;&lt; ""[foo's arguments]"" &lt;&lt; ""|&amp;"" &lt;&lt; ""tee"" &lt;&lt; ""foo.log"";
// set the process env and working dir
child-&gt;start(prog, args);


Does anyone have any advice on how to solve this?
I have tried redirecting stdout and stderr using QProcess.setStandardErrorFile(foo.log) and QProcess.setStandardOutputFile(foo.log), but it seems like that would be redirecting the stdout from the gnome-terminal itself (which isn't anything).

"14006512","So I have been trying to port a C GNOME applet to MATE, and after running into many different problems, I decided to rewrite it from scratch in python. Eventually, I found some not-horribly-out-of-date documentation, which is here: <a href=""http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/docs:devel:mate-panel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/docs:devel:mate-panel</a>

Apparently the new way of writing applets in python is to use PyGObject introspection, instead of the 'old' PyGtk.

So I have a few questions:

1. Why is it better to use PyGObject instead of PyGtk etc
2. Is the end user who downloads a python applet expected to have pygobject installed? It looks like it.
3. The MATE documentation says 'ensure we are using Gtk 2, not Gtk3', but http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html says that its exclusively supports Gtk+ 3 and higher.


EDIT: If I run 

import gi
gi.require_version(""Gtk"", ""2.0"")


in a python session, I get the warning:

RuntimeWarning: You have imported the Gtk 2.0 module.  Because Gtk 2.0 was not designed for use with introspection some of the interfaces and API will fail.  As such this is not supported by the pygobject development team and we encourage you to port your app to Gtk 3 or greater. PyGTK is the recomended python module to use with Gtk 2.0


Which pretty much answers Question 3, but then brings up Question 1 again. Also, running from gi.repository import MatePanelApplet gives an ImportError Could not find any typelib for MatePanelApplet even though I have libmatepanelapplet-dev installed. 

EDIT AGAIN: I found a solution to the ImportError here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7823972/cant-import-webkit-from-gi-repository"">Can&#39;t import Webkit from gi.repository</a>. (Just install gir1.2-mate-panel instead of webkit)

And more errors:

I'm using Conky on my Archlinux distro and coded a quick script in python to check if I have a new mail in my gmail. In my conkyrc this script executes every 5 minutes and returns a number of mails (0 if I don't have any). Works fine.   

What I wanted to do is :<br>
If the number of mail is > 0 then display a notification (a gnome-shell notification). The only problem I have now is that if I have unread mails (for example 4 mails unread), each 5 minutes, there will be a NEW notification saying that I have 4 mails unread. What I would like to do is checking if there is already a notification so that I don't have to display it again... Does anyone know how to solve that kind of problem ?

"14314497","I have a number of computers (clients) distributed around the house and are connected through a wired LAN. My goal is to collect video streams from all of these computers and display them on a single (server) large screen. Clients can stream their desktop, or a video file, or a text (as an image), or whatever. 

At this point I prepare the low-resolution visual data on the clients and display them individually on the server using OpenGL. Now I want to create a dynamic grid and show multiple streams on the same window. Dynamic, because at any given time only some of the clients will be streaming. I want to make these grid change its structure depending on the number of active clients. The clients and the server, are all running Linux and Gnome. I'm currently inclined to go with OpenGL and to use a separate thread for each client. I don't know if this is a good idea since each stream might have a different update rate.

What do you think is the simplest way, as in less coding without sacrificing flexibility, to achieve this functionality? Which technology is most suitable for this task? I have very limited knowledge on graphics programming.

But I write it in C++, so I prefer to have a C++ class interface, just like I use gtkmm and not GTK+ directly.

The documentation (see link above) says I can use GObject Introspection. So I started reading anout it. I read and read and read, and I just couldn't understand how to use any binding of GOffice. I looked for a goffice gi-repository/typelib file on my system, and in the list of files installed by PackageKit. Found nothing. I checked in PackageKit if goffice or goffice-devel packages depend on the gobject introspection package. Maybe they depend indirectly, but they don't depend on it directly (otherwise I'd see it on the list).

I tried and tried, but I couldn't find a resource which could simply explain how to take a library written in GObject, such as GOffice, and use it on another language, e.g. Python, or in my case C++. Of course, I can use the C functions directly, but the point is that I want to have an interface similar to gtkmm.

So, the base has been programmed, eg.:


Create and connect the ListStore to a TreeView Object
OpenFile Dialog - Select a MP3/OGG/WAV-File
Get the File Name and URI from OpenFile Dialog and put it into the Gtk.ListStore Object
When the File gets selected (in the TreeView Object) the Gst Object fetches the URI from the currently selected line.


The problem is now that I want to manually change the selected Line in the TreeView Object (when the user presses the Forward or Back Button), and I don't have a clue how to do this.

I looked it up at the official GNOME-Docs, at the unofficial Seed <a href=""http://www.roojs.com/seed/gir-1.2-gtk-3.0/gjs/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Documentation</a> and Google'd it up with no results. I tried to find it out with the C-Docs of GNOME 3, but still nothing.

But now problem is that all results get displayed on same terminal.
I want to know is there any way such that after each fork() or process creation new terminal gets opened and all results get displayed for that process on particular terminal.

P.S: I have tried system(""gnome-terminal"")  but it just opens new terminal but all results get displayed again on same terminal only. All new terminals are just opens and remain  blank without any result.

Also I have gone through this link <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3445645/how-to-invoke-another-terminal-for-output-programmatically-in-c-in-linux"">How to invoke another terminal for output programmatically in C in Linux</a> but I don't want to run my program with parameters or whatever.

Here is my code:-

for(int i=0;i&lt;node-1;i++)
  {
    n_number++;
    usleep(5000);
    child_pid[i]=fork();
    if(!child_pid[i])

  }
  for(int i=0;i&lt;node-1;i++)
    wait(&amp;status);


So basically what I want is for each process there should be new terminal displaying only that process information or result.

What I exactly want:


After fork() I have some data related to say process 1 then I want its output to one terminal
Same goes with each process. So its like if I have 3 process then there must be 3 terminals and each must display process related data only. 


I know it can be doable using IPC(Inter Process Communication) but is there any other way around? I mean just 2-3 commands or so? Because I do not want to invest too much in coding this part.

A simple CLI tool to manipulate the data is gconftool-2, which returns values for keys using the --get option.

I don't know to to infer the type from these values considering that I need to know the value when setting it back to something. Notice, in my schema, ""8"" is a string and 8 is an int, but they are both output as just 8 by gconftool-2.

How would you go about doing this?

"16761211","Yesterday I tried updating from MATE 1.4 to MATE 1.6. I didn't like some things about it, and I decided to switch back, at least for now. One of the changes was a switch from the mateconf configuration system to GNOME 3's GSettings. As I understand this is a frontend to a system called dconf  (or connected some other way).

This rendered many of my settings viod. I figured I could try to migrate them, but unlike gconf and mateconf, which created convenient folders in my home directory and filled them with XML I could edit or copy, I wasn't able to find any trace of dconf's settings storage.

A new Control Center is provided (and mandatory to install) but I don't want to be clicking through dozens of dialogs just to restore settings I already have. The Configuration Editor utility might be okay, but it only works with mateconf.

So what I want to know is where I can find the files created by dconf and how I can modify them directly, without relying on special tools.

I'm writing in C++ but I don't mind using a C library and wrap it in my own C++ wrapper. I also prefer to use existing common libraries than add dependencies on 3rd party libraries.

I found two libraries which seem to be standard, libuuid (which comes with the Linux kernel as  part of util-linux) and the OSSP uuid library, which has a C++ binding.

No program on my system uses OSSP uuid library, but my whole desktop depends on the libuuid package, probably because the kernel itself depends on it.

The question is, which one should I use? Is there a difference or I can just choose randomly? I don't know why there are different implementations, but I'd like to choose one and stick with it.

After the execution is finished, the typing feedback is gone (I can't see what I'm typing), and also line breaks are not displayed. This happens if the terminal is started remotely via Putty, and also locally when using gnome-terminal.

For example, after the problem happens, if I type <kbd>ENTER</kbd> pwd <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, I would expect to see:

[userA@host006 ~]$ pwd

$HOME/OpenFOAM/user-2.2.1

mkdir -p /FOAM_RUN

the problem is that the final directory (run) should have the following form:

/home/OpenFOAM/user-2.2.1/run

but using Debian I cannot create a dir with ""sudo"", so I have to do it as root and when I go inside the directory /home/OpenFOAM/user-2.2.1 and I do mkdir -p /FOAM_RUN , then the created folder is:

and I need it to be created in the /home directory and not in the /root directory. I had created the folder just using

mkdir -p /home/OpenFOAM/user-2.2.1/run

but when I try to execute the OpenFOAM orders it doesn't work.

My questions are:

Why should mkdir $FOAM_RUN create the run directory and if I do it just as ""mkdir run"", it doesn't work?

Why is the ""$"" symbol there when I use mkdir? I was searching for it and (for example) the mkdir manual says nothing about it.

"18901949","I would like to write a gnome-shell extension, which involves some dbus calling in gjs.

I have learned that Gio.DBus is the right module to use, but I failed to make it run correctly. To demonstrate what I mean, I prepared the following ""incorrect"" code, which attempts to call the ListNames method in org.freedesktop.DBus interface. I didn't see any output when I run this incorrect code.

Incorrect code:

const Gio = imports.gi.Gio;

const DBusDaemonIface = &lt;interface name='org.freedesktop.DBus'&gt;
    &lt;method name='ListNames'&gt;
        &lt;arg type='as' direction='out'/&gt;
    &lt;/method&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;;

const DBusDaemonProxy = Gio.DBusProxy.makeProxyWrapper(DBusDaemonIface);

let main = function () {
    var gdbusProxy = new DBusDaemonProxy(Gio.DBus.session, 'org.freedesktop.DBus', '/org/freedesktop/DBus');
    gdbusProxy.ListNamesRemote(function(result, error){ print(result); });
};

main();


For comparison, the following code works. The difference I made is to define a TestApp class which extends Gio.Application, which gets instantiated in the main() function.

Correct code:

const Gio = imports.gi.Gio;
const Lang = imports.lang;

const DBusDaemonIface = &lt;interface name='org.freedesktop.DBus'&gt;
    &lt;method name='ListNames'&gt;
        &lt;arg type='as' direction='out'/&gt;
    &lt;/method&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;;

const DBusDaemonProxy = Gio.DBusProxy.makeProxyWrapper(DBusDaemonIface);

TestApp = new Lang.Class({
    Name: 'TestApp',
    Extends: Gio.Application,

    _init: function() {
        this.parent({application_id: 'testapp_id',
            flags: Gio.ApplicationFlags.NON_UNIQUE });

        this._gdbusProxy = new DBusDaemonProxy(Gio.DBus.session,
            'org.freedesktop.DBus', '/org/freedesktop/DBus');
    this._gdbusProxy.ListNamesRemote(Lang.bind(this, this._listNames));
    },

    _listNames: function(result, error) {
    print(result);
    },

    vfunc_activate: function() {
        this.hold();
    },

});

let main = function () {
    let app = new TestApp();
    return app.run(ARGV);
};

main();


So my guess is to make GDBus work, you need a Gio.Application to run? This could be a very stupid question, because I have zero experience programming for GNOME. Thanks.

"18981190","I'm trying to listen for MediaKey events under Gnome 3 (Gnome Shell).  All the examples I find refer to using DBus to connect to org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.MediaKeys.  This service doesn't seem to exist on my platform.  

I'm trying to do this using Python via GObject-Introspection.  The examples say do something like this

from gi.reposiotry import Gio

connection = Gio.bus_get_sync(Gio.BusType.SESSION, None)
proxy = Gio.DBusProxy.new_sync(connection, 0, None, 'org.gnome.SettingsDaemon', '/org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/MediaKeys', 'org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.MediaKeys', None)


This fails, unsurprisingly.  Am I missing an install which provides this service, or do I have to do this another way?

UPDATE

This is for a media key listener, which listens for key events no matter which window has the focus.  It's meant for an app which doesn't even have it's own GUI, and is Desktop wide.  That's why I tried the Mediakeys DBus service, only to find it is missing from my Desktop.

UPDATE 2

I should be clear, the MediaKeys service is not present.  I can't event connect to the service and create the proxy as it's not there.  What I'm wanting to know is, am I missing an install, or was this service removed in one of the Gnome 3 updates?  If it was removed, then how can I listen for Media Keys in this new environment? I'm running Gnome 3.8.2.

UPDATE 3

Sorry should have mentioned this in the first place.  I'll perfect my question asking one day :-}.  I'm running Gentoo.

"19770591","I'm developing a Qt4 app and running it under gnome, but I would really like it to use a KDE system theme (Oxygen) and color scheme (Obsidian Coast).  Unfortunately, the application doesn't seem to respond to changes in systemsettings.

I am at least able to get the app to use the theme I want programmatically by setting the QStyle:

QApplication app( argc, argv );
app.setStyle(QStyleFactory::create(""oxygen"");


but I don't know of any similar approach for setting the color scheme, and this is kind of ugly anyway.

Interestingly, I've already developed some PyQt4 apps on this same machine and they pick up changes in systemsettings just fine.  I'm not really sure why a C++ Qt4 app would behave differently.

One more note: I've noticed that changing the window appearance via the gnome dialog will affect my C++ qt window's appearance - so perhaps Gnome is overriding my KDE configuration somehow?

After the installation finished I typed ""startx"" and the GUI began to start. It loads until I receive the error:

  Cogl is a modern 3D graphics API with associated utility APIs designed to expose the features of 3D graphics hardware using a more object oriented design than OpenGL. The library has primarily been driven by the practical needs of Clutter but it is not tied to any one toolkit or even constrained to developing UI toolkits.
</blockquote>

I have known the names of the common gnome libraries: cairo, pango, gtk, clutter and cogl for a long time, but recently i actually found out what the the libraries did. And the gnome documentation just told me that cogl can draw 3D in a more oo way, as shown in the quote above. But i find it hard to get started.

So How can i use cogl to draw a 3d cube in vala?
Is it possible to animate the cube with clutter?

after looking through the internet, i couldn't find much. so i went to Github to look at some other peoples code but most of the code is made in C and seemed hard to read. 

Can you show some examples or links to some examples written in vala? (can also be in C, but it makes it a little harder to read)

It works somehow but after a while (that means a longer startup code - talking about > 26 s) it stops printing out the messages, but grabserial still is running - i have to hit the [CTRL-C] to retrieve control. I checked the serial port with putty and it's working so it's a problem with grabserial. But i can't think of what it is.

I downloaded and installed with both of the 2 install-variants and it just changed the look-and-feel but stucks at the same point.

Does anyone ever had the same problem ?

Greets

[edit:] i just checked the code, it's nothing special and actually should just break when [CTRL-C] or a timer was set and running out. But the program doesn't even break it just stops printing to console.

[edit2:] i found out, that script is too slow for processing. It seems like it only can output information when something has been sent by the serial line (like an interrupt), but it's like 2 letters transmitted but only 1 is shown. Since the script-processing is slower than booting i can't see everything, only the stuff it managed to show until my device finishes booting. I tried this with a reboot-loop process, so it gets new messages over and over again, and it never stopped printing out.

I still need support for this, does anyone have smart solution before i have to code it by my own?

I use the xfce terminal in drop-down mode connected to a hotkey. It closes when another window becomes active, which is just fine. What is not fine, however, is that when I use git and have it pull or push to an https url, it pops up a fun box to ask me for my password instead of just letting me enter it directly on the command line.

Normally I would google around to find the answer to this, but sadly most people are trying to get git to stop asking for a password altogether rather than prevent a dialog box, so this is hard for me to google (trust me; I've tried for a couple months now on and off when I get annoyed enough).

How can I prevent git from popping up any graphical windows for things like passwords? Git says that it is using /usr/lib/seahorse/seahorse-ssh-askpass for asking the password, so if there is some configuration option to prevent it from using that (or that has an equivalent effect), that would be great.

So I wasn't surprised when I got around today to upgrading from Ubunto 12.10 to 13.10 that, once again, it broke NoMachine. But this time, I cań't find a solution after searching the web for a couple hours.

The problem is that for some reason Ubuntu is unable to execute the fallback to GNOME classic (no effects), which NoMachine says is required. I followed the instructions on the NoMachine site for configuring NoMachine 4, which is to sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback and then insert DefaultDesktopCommand ""/etc/X11/Xsession gnome-session-fallback"" into the file &lt;installationDirectory&gt;/NX/etc/node.cfg.

Before and after doing this, when I try to create a gnome session from a remote NoMachine client, I get the error message

Xsession: unable to launch ""gnome-session-fallback"" X session ---""gnome-session-fallback""
not found: falling back to default session


And then it just displays a black screen.

I tried using gnome-session-flashback per some comments on other forums, and that didn't help. I also tried using xfce4 instead of gnome. That brings up a desktop, but then the client Seg Faults as soon as I try to interact with the desktop.

"23587630","This must be some basic misunderstanding (on my side) on how gnome-shell extensions work.  I struggled to find some documentation but, alas, it seems a bit sparse. 

I want to write a simple extension to toggle focus mode from FFM to click-to-focus clicking on an icon in a panel, due to the fact that I normally use FFM, but some program is broken with it. So I started with the basic gnome-shell-extension-tool --create-extension and modified it in the following way: 

const St = imports.gi.St;
const Main = imports.ui.main;
const Tweener = imports.ui.tweener;

let text, button, icon;

var toggle;

function _hideHello() {
    Main.uiGroup.remove_actor(text);
    text = null;
}

function _showHello(what) {
    if (!text) {
        text = new St.Label({ style_class: 'helloworld-label', text: what });
        Main.uiGroup.add_actor(text);
    }

    text.opacity = 255;
    let monitor = Main.layoutManager.primaryMonitor;
    text.set_position(Math.floor(monitor.width / 2 - text.width / 2),
                      Math.floor(monitor.height / 2 - text.height / 2));
    Tweener.addTween(text,
                     { opacity: 0,
                       time: 2,
                       transition: 'easeOutQuad',
                       onComplete: _hideHello });
}

function _switch() {
    if (toggle == 0) {
        toggle = 1;
        _showHello(""Setting toggle to "" + toggle);
    }
    if (toggle == 1) {
        toggle = 0;
        _showHello(""Setting toggle to "" + toggle);
    }
}

function init() {
    button = new St.Bin({ style_class: 'panel-button',
                          reactive: true,
                          can_focus: true,
                          x_fill: true,
                          y_fill: false,
                          track_hover: true });
    icon = new St.Icon({ icon_name: 'system-run-symbolic',
                             style_class: 'system-status-icon' });
    button.set_child(icon);
    toggle = 0;
    button.connect('button-press-event', _switch);
}

function enable() {
    Main.panel._rightBox.insert_child_at_index(button, 0);
}

function disable() {
    Main.panel._rightBox.remove_child(button);
}


with the (probably naïve) idea that each time I pressed the button I could switch toggle from 0 to 1 and vice-versa. 

Instead, what happens is that every time I click on the button, the same ""Setting toggle to 1"" message is shown.

Can anyone explain what is happening? Thanks.

"23635061","The following code snippet is from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK%2B"" rel=""nofollow"">GTK+</a> 3 tutorial from GNOME given <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-getting-started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

static void
print_hello (GtkWidget *widget,
             gpointer   data)
{

{
  g_print (""delete event occurred\n"");
  return TRUE;
}


The program is very simple, and it only has a toplevel window and a button. And this is how the callbacks have been connected:

 g_signal_connect (window, ""delete-event"", G_CALLBACK (on_delete_event), NULL);
 g_signal_connect (window, ""destroy"", G_CALLBACK (gtk_main_quit), NULL);
 g_signal_connect (button, ""clicked"", G_CALLBACK (print_hello), NULL);
 g_signal_connect_swapped (button, ""clicked"", G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy), window);


My question is regarding the arguments we pass to the callback functions. Why is it that in the on_delete_event handler we pass the second argument GdkEvent* data?

Alternatively, why do we pass no such argument to the first callback function. What is the use of the GdkEvent parameter in this scenario?

I'm sorry if the question shows lack of research, but for me neither the tutorial, nor <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/gdk3/stable/gdk3-Event-Structures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the resource on event structures</a> was clear enough in describing callbacks.

"23846909","This problem is getting me really crazy. I used Gvim and Autohotkey under Windows 7 in the past. For various reasons, I mapped CTRL+D to behave likes Enter. This worked well so far. 
In Gvim I mapped the Enter/Return to act as page down key:

nnoremap &lt;cr&gt; &lt;PageDown&gt; 


This worked good. Previous week I decided to give Ubuntu a try again. 

With Autokey, I remapped my CTRL+D to behave likes Enter. 

keyboard.send_key(""&lt;enter&gt;"")


This worked fine in everything in Ubuntu/Xubuntu, in browser/Chrome, in text editors, everything. I'm using Gnome Terminal. And there, CTRL+D behaves like Enter. 

When I am in Vim in insert mode, CTRL+D does the same as Enter. In normal mode, I don't get the expected behaviour with nnoremap  . 

I found this very odd, given the fact the CTRL+D worked good in terminal and in insert mode in Vim. When I press the 'real' Enter. I get the behaviour (Page down in Vim) but I don't get the same behaviour with mapped CTRL+D in normal mode. In insert mode, it behaves like Enter. I tried to change the maps, in order to detect the problem, like: 

nnoremap &lt;return&gt; &lt;PageDown&gt;

nnoremap &lt;Enter&gt; &lt;PageDown&gt;

nnoremap &lt;cr&gt; ij

nnoremap &lt;CR&gt; ij


Nothing of them worked so far with CTRL+D in normal mode. I find it oddly that it worked well in Insert mode and in terminal. I looked into Vim's manual to get some ideas what went here. With no results sofar. 

I use Vim as my daily editor, so I feel so angry about this, because I don't understand why this issue occur in normal mode. Anyone know what is going on there? I would really appreciate your help, because this is making me really crazy.

These images are not recognized and by default they are opened with Gimp (which is not what we want!). The most common program to open such images is <a href=""http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SAO ds9</a>, which is downloaded as an executable.

I can open images in the command line and there is no problem. In GNOME2.x, I would simply click ""open with"" and write the command to open FITS images with the ds9 -mecube command and there was no problem. But in GNOME 3, there is no such option. After some searching I thought that creating a .desktop file would be the best solution. So I made this desktop file in: /usr/share/applications/saods9.desktop

Type=Application
Name=SAO ds9
Encoding=UTF-8
Comment=Open ds9 as multiextension data cube
Exec=/usr/local/bin/ds9 -mecube %f

The SAO ds9 option was added to the programs list in the Open With menu, but when I click on it, nothing happens. It is also included under the Graphics applications in the ""Applications"" menu and when I click it there it opens, but it doesn't open a file when I click on it.

The squashfs image is based on a snapshot of a working VM. The base system with it's services like ssh work out of the box as expected. But when trying to launch gnome via systemd (systemctl start gdm), all I see is a black screen (supposedly the X-Server started but gdm fails to load). I already tried to figure out whats happening, but failed to identify the exact problem.


Home directories are writeable
/tmp is writeable
/var/log is writeable
/var/run &amp; /run are writeable anyway


/var/log/gdm gets created but stays empty.
Which modules may require write access to any other files? Is there any documentation? What would make sense to strace or similar?

My desire is to know the root of the problem and fix it, instead of using workarounds like unionfs. Thanks for any help or hints!

Although it's not relevant, for those who might wonder why I want to do this, here are some points to consider:


Stability - as you cannot modify system files, you cannot mess up the system (unless you write bogus directly to the drive of course)
Storage - as files are compressed, more data fits on the drive
Performance - as I/O on most USB drives is slow, compression gives you higher I/O speed
Portability - no special treatment for read-only storage, you might copy it on a CD or any other read-only technology and it will still work the same way as it would on a writeable disk


Update

I figured out that the problem was actually at /var/lib/gdm. GDM tried to access files in there an (silently) failed doing so giving me a black screen.

If these commands could run independently and in parallel, I'd just adapt the answer to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3896882/open-gnome-terminal-programmatically-and-execute-commands-after-bashrc-was-execu?rq=1"">this question</a>. In fact, I tried, using the following shell script:


gnome-terminal --working-directory=""/home/superelectric"" --tab -t ""gate"" -e 'bash -c ""export BASH_POST_RC=\""ssh gate_tunnel\""; exec bash""' --tab -t ""mydesktop"" -e 'bash -c ""export BASH_POST_RC=\""ssh tunneled_mydesktop\""; exec bash""'


Spread out over multiple lines, for readability:

gnome-terminal \
  --working-directory=""/home/superelectric"" \
  --tab \
  -t ""gate"" \
  -e \
    'bash -c ""export BASH_POST_RC=\""ssh gate_tunnel\""; exec bash""' \
  --tab \
  -t ""mydesktop"" \
  -e \
    'bash -c ""export BASH_POST_RC=\""ssh tunneled_mydesktop\""; exec bash""'


The first part opens a tab, names it 'gate', and executes 'ssh gate_tunnel' within it. This is an ssh alias that opens a tunnel to 'mydesktop' at school, through the school's outward-facing server, 'gate'.

The second part opens another tab, names it 'mydesktop', and executes 'ssh tunneled_mydesktop' within it. This is another ssh alias, which connects to mydesktop through the tunnel.

~/.ssh/config: 

Host gate_tunnel
  LocalForward 8023 &lt;my_desktop_at_school&gt;:22
  HostName &lt;my_school_server&gt;


That's the theory. In practice, the two commands execute in parallel, whereas I need to ensure that the first tab's command (open tunnel) completes before executing the second tab's command (connect through tunnel).

Is there maybe some command I can execute in the second tab, that 'waits' until the ssh tunnel is opened?

<blockquote>
  ""Writeable memory is the amount of address space that your process has
  allocated with write privileges""
</blockquote>

and 

<blockquote>
  ""Virtual memory is the address space that your application has
  allocated""
</blockquote>

1) If I have allocated memory myself, surely it has write privileges?

2) The linked question also states (regarding malloc)

<blockquote>
  ""...which won't actually allocate any memory. (See the rant at the end
  of the malloc(3) page for details.)""
</blockquote>

I don't see any ""rant"", and my images show the virtual memory has increased!  Can someone explain this please?

3) If I have purely the following code:

char* p = new char[100];


...the resource monitor shows that both Memory and Writeable Memory have increased by 8KB - the same as when I was allocating a full one megabyte! - with Virtual memory increasing by 0.1.  What is happening here?

4) What column should I be looking at in the resource monitor to see how much memory my app is using?

However I can't manage to get it to work. Here's what i got so far (relevant part):

    output_reader.read_line_async(0, null, _SocketRead, null);

        let [lineout, charlength, error] = output_reader.read_line_finish();

        receivedline = lineout;
        // process received data

    }


The async function is started just fine and also _SocketRead gets called, when there's a line received from the server,  but it fails to read the data with read_line_finish().

I'm completely new to gio and Extension development so I might just miss something obvious.

To me it seems like read_line_finish() may be missing it's <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GAsyncResult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GAsyncResult</a> parameter, but i've got no clue on how to implement it.

In a traditional terminal window, I either call fzf or type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to launch it. My problem is that I'm unable to reproduce this programmatically (so that I can assign it to a Gnome keyboard shortcut). gnome-terminal --command=""fzf"" tells me it couldn't find a process named fzf. gnome-terminal --command=""xdotool key ctrl+t"" doesn't do anything but does work if I call it from an open terminal window.

I pretty much well understood the pipeline and element stuff, I also figured out how to seek to a wanted playback time (when the user changes the value of the scale), but i wonder what's the best way to automatically update the slider/scale when the file is playing. One way, implemented <a href=""http://www.eurion.net/python-snippets/snippet/Seeking%20with%20gstreamer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> using the old API, is to use a timer that periodically reads the current player position and updates the slider's position:

{
""shell_cmd"": ""g++ -std=c++11 \""${file}\"" -o \""${file_path}/${file_base_name}.exe\"""",
""file_regex"": ""^(..[^:]*):([0-9]+):?([0-9]+)?:? (.*)$"",
""working_dir"": ""${file_path}"",
""selector"": ""source.c, source.c++, source.cpp"",

""variants"":
[
    {
        ""name"": ""Run"",
        ""shell_cmd"": ""g++ \""${file}\"" -o \""${file_path}/${file_base_name}\""""
    }
]}


Above code is only create a executable file. which I have to run manually in terminal. 

And,

{
""cmd"": [""g++"", ""$file"", ""-o"", ""${file_path}/${file_base_name}""],
""file_regex"": ""^(..[^:]*):([0-9]+):?([0-9]+)?:? (.*)$"",
""working_dir"": ""${file_path}"",
""selector"": ""source.c, source.c++, source.cxx, source.cpp"",
""variants"":
[
    {
        ""cmd"": ""g++ \""${file}\"" -o \""${file_path}/${file_base_name}\"""",
        ""variants"":
[
    {
        ""name"": ""Run"",
        ""shell"": true,
        ""cmd"": [""gnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \""${file_path}/${file_base_name};echo;echo;  echo Press ENTER to continue; read line;exit; exec bash\""'""]
    }
]  
    }

]    }


This code can run only existing file in terminal.

Now, I just want to write code in SublimeText and execute it in terminal automatically.

Thanks.

"29359241","On Gnome I have been playing around with the dconf. I am trying to write some Python scripts to manipulate some of the entries myself. Some of them have the type a(ss). So my first question is: what does this type mean?

I'm handling the dconf thus:

from gi.repository import Gio
entries = Gio.Settings.new(path)
value1 = entries.get_string(key1) # for reading a string value
entries.set_string(key2, value2)  # for writing a string value


This works fine, until I try to work with a key whose type is a(ss). The methods get_string() and set_string() fail because of a wrong type. So my second question is: what are the right methods to use in this case?

I am using Python 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 14.10.

"29440290","By issuing the following commands:

touch foo bar
echo foo bar | parallel --tty -Xj1 vim


The last command does not open the foo and bar files in the Vim editor but shortly afterwards prevents the current tab of the GNOME terminal from accepting any key presses such as CTRL-C, CTRL-D etc. To recover the current terminal tab must be closed via the 'X' button.

Any ideas how to make the last command work?

And now I want to move them around with animations, using translation_x, translation_y and resizing their width.

What is the recommended way to do that?

Won't the layout that places actors according to rules conflict with the new positions of the actors?

Should I sever the ties to the layout (by nullify the layoutmanager property) ?
